Setting Up a PHP Website with Docker:
To get started, you’ll need Docker installed on your system. Once Docker is set up, follow these steps to create a PHP website using Docker containers:

➤ Create a directory for your project and navigate into it.

➤ Create a file named Dockerfile in the project directory. This file will contain instructions for building the Docker image for your PHP website. Here’s a basic example of a Dockerfile for a PHP website:

# Use the official PHP image as the base image
FROM php:7.4-apache

# Copy the PHP files into the container
COPY src/ /var/www/html/

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80
➤ Create a directory named src inside your project directory and place your PHP files inside it.

➤ Build the Docker image using the following command:

docker build -t php-website .
➤ Once the image is built, you can run a container using the following command:

docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name php-container php-website
This command will start a container named php-container based on the php-website image and map port 8080 on the host to port 80 on the container.
